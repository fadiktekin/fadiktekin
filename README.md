## Hi there! üê£
I'm Fadik, a frontend developer based in Berlin, Germany. My career began in games industry building mobileüì± games and later moved to fintech building webüï∏Ô∏è applications.

When I'm tired of screens, I like crocheting. You can see some of my work in [ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/fadik-makes) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fadik._.makes/).
